# 12
Write C++ statements that accomplish the following. (6, 7)
#### a. Declare `int` variables `x` and `y`. Initialize `x` to `25` and `y` to `18`.
```
int x = 25, y = 18;
```

#### b. Declare and initialize an int variable temp to 10 and a char variable ch to 'A'.


#### c. Update the value of an int variable x by adding 5 to it.


#### d. Declare and initialize a double variable payRate to 12.50.


#### e. Copy the value of an int variable firstNum into an int variable tempNum.


#### f. Swap the contents of the int variables x and y. (Declare additional variables, if necessary.)


#### g. Suppose x and y are double variables. Output the contents of x, y, and the expression `x + 12 / y – 18`.


#### h. Declare a char variable grade and set the value of grade to 'A'.


#### i. Declare int variables to store four integers.


#### j. Copy the value of a double variable z to the nearest integer into an int variable x.




# 14
Suppose x, y, z, and w are int variables. What value is assigned to each of these variables after the last statement executes?	(4, 6)
```
x = 7; y = 2 * x - 3;
z = x + y - 3;
x = z / y;
y = z - x;
w = x + y + 2 * z;
w--;
y = 2 * w + z - x;
```


# 16
Suppose x,y,and z are int variables and x = 18, y = 5,and z = 4. What is the output of each of the following statements? (3, 4, 10)
#### a. `cout << "x = " << x << ", y = " << y << ", z = " << z << endl;`


#### b. `cout << "5 * x - y = " << 5 * x - y << endl;`


#### c. `cout << "Product of " << x << " and " << z << " is " << x * z << endl;`


#### d. `cout << "x - y / z = " << x - y / z << endl;`


#### e. `cout << x << " square = " << x * x << endl;`




# 18
Write C++ statements that accomplish the following. (10)
#### a. Outputs the newline character.


#### b. Outputs the tab character.


#### c. Outputs double quotation mark.




# 20
Give meaningful identifiers for the following variables and write a proper C++ declaration and initialization to a reasonable value. (1, 6, 7)
#### a. A variable to store the letter grade, (A, B, C, D, or F).


#### b. A variable to store the sales tax price of an item.


#### c. A variable to store the number of juice bottles sold.


#### d. A variable to store the billing amount of a doctor’s visit.


#### e. A variable to store the grade point average (GPA).
